# deadlockedPhilosophers
This code represents an individual project I created for [CAP4800 - Systems Simulation at University of Florida in Fall 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051226075334/http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~fishwick/cap4800/) visualizing [dining philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) and resource deadlock. The code was written and should still be runnable in [Processing](https://processing.org/).
