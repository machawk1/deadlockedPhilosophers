# deadlockedPhilosophers
This code represents an individual project I created for [CAP4800 - Systems Simulation at University of Florida in Fall 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051226075334/http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~fishwick/cap4800/) visualizing [dining philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) and resource deadlock. The code was written and should still be runnable in [Processing](https://processing.org/). The code is not the final version, which was lost due to poor source control practices and is observable by some of the image resources being unused in the code. Despite this and the code having lived on various hard drive over the last 10 years, I have uploaded it to GitHub for later findability.
